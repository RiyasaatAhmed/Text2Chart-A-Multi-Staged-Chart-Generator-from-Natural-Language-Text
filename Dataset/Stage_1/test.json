Before I could understand his style , in the second round he improvised and I missed most of my attacks and received a lot of blows from him resulting in a very low score of 1 . Third round I changed my strategy and worked on my defense and got a better understanding with his renewed approach ; so I scored 3 . Applying the knowledge coupled with my new strategy I landed the most aggressive blows and put him on the ground resulting in a successful round with a score of 8 . However , he got back up and in the next round he fought back much better , and although I successfully landed a few fatal blows the success rate decreases and I couldn ' t knock him out in the final round scoring 3 points again . It was one hell of a fight .",
